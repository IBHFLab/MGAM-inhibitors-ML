# MGAM-inhibitors-ML
This study constructed a high-quality MGAM inhibitor dataset by integrating 1,155 compounds from ChEMBL, BindingDB, and literature reports. Physicochemical property analysis confirmed the drug-like characteristics of the dataset, with the flavonoid scaffold (C6–C3–C6) identified as a privileged structure. Through systematic comparison of nine ML algorithms and seven molecular representation methods, models based on ECFPs fingerprints—DNN, RF, and XGB—demonstrated optimal predictive performance. This study provides reliable computational models and clear structure-activity relationship guidance for MGAM inhibitor discovery.
